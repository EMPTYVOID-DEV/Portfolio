**Functional programming** is a paradigm that, once mastered, can elevate you from a junior to a senior-level engineer. It enables you to write significantly faster, more maintainable code. Beyond efficiency, functional programming brings a unique joy to coding.

## Concepts

We'll explore functional programming concepts using fp-ts, a library that simplifies applying these principles in TypeScript, making them more accessible and practical for developers

### Pure functions

In functional programming we want most our functions to be pure functions which have these properties.

- **Deterministic**: Same input always produces the same output.

- **Total**: Every possible input maps to an output.

- **No Side Effects**: Can't read or modify external data.

With these properties, pure functions are predictable, less prone to errors, easier to test, and can be optimized through memoization.

### Immutablility

We prefer immutable variables, creating new ones instead of modifying existing data. This may seem unnecessary, but mutating data can cause significant issues, especially in JavaScript due to its special scoping.

### Functions composition

We aim to create compact, reusable functions and combine their logic sequentially, gradually transforming data shape. The fp-ts library offers two useful functions: flow, which accepts multiple functions and returns a composed function, and pipe, which executes passed functions with a given argument and yields the final result.

```typescript
import { flow } from 'fp-ts/function';

function base64ToBuffer(base64: string) {
	return Buffer.from(base64, 'base64');
}

function bufferToBlob(buffer: Buffer) {
	return new Blob([buffer]);
}

const base64ToBlob = flow(base64ToBuffer, bufferToBlob);
```

Using flow, we combine base64ToBuffer and bufferToBlob to create the base64ToBlob function. fp-ts also handles errors when incompatible functions are passed. This approach ensures type safety and composition, key principles in functional programming.

### Currying

Currying takes a non-unary function and returns a sequence of unary functions. This technique enables partial application, function composition, and enhanced code reusability.

### Either and Option

Either and Option are monads (a complex topic deserving its own blog post) that aid in preventing numerous bugs.

#### Either

Either is a structure encapsulating a value A with a potential error E. It provides robust error handling and type safety.

```typescript
import { ZodError, ZodSchema } from 'zod';
import { Either, left, right } from 'fp-ts/Either';

export function validator<A>(
	data: Record<string, unknown>,
	schema: ZodSchema
): Either<ZodError, A> {
	const result = schema.safeParse(data);
	return result.success ? right(result.data) : left(result.error);
}
```

This general Zod validator returns an Either of ZodError and generic A. We construct Either with right for A and left for errors.

We can check the **\_tag** property to determine which case it is:

```typescript
const either = validator({ age: 30 }, schema);
if (either._tag === 'right') console.log(either.right);
```

#### Option

Option represents a value that may or may not exist. It's useful for handling nullable values safely.

```typescript
import { Option, some, none } from 'fp-ts/Option';

function divide(a: number, b: number): Option<number> {
	return b === 0 ? none : some(a / b);
}

const result = divide(10, 2);
if (result._tag === 'some') {
	console.log(result.value); // 5
}

const impossible = divide(10, 0);
if (impossible._tag === 'none') {
	console.log("Can't divide by zero");
}
```

There are numerous additional concepts in functional programming, including recursion, memoization, functors, and generators. Exploring all of these in depth would transform this post into a comprehensive book.
